##### Not so productive tips

I live in a strange world. Being part of an agile team, we use jira for all of our work, everything is broken down into small chunks, very small chunks. We have limits on the number of points any task can have when being taken into sprint. This was done as estimations were going way over and since doing that there has been a marked improvement in our burndown. Dont get me wrong, and I get burnt by this quite a bit dabbling in the world of Kubernetes, we still have things go wrong, things that you expect to be fairly easy really bite you, things that should be more complex sail through but we are averaging a good 80% completion of tasks in a sprint. Far better than I expected we could get to with the many dependencies that we have on external teams, being as we are the team that sits in the middle of everyone.
All in all, my boss is impressed with my delivery but, and possibly more importantly, I'm very happy with the work I do and what I manage to get done.

### Here is the kicker

So, why isn't it like that in my personal life? Over the past year I felt that I had been failing to just do stuff, someone who knows me well pulled me up when I casually mentioned this, laughing at me and calling out the "not done anything" that I had mentioned, with a long list of what they knew I had done. I decided to sit down and workout, what I had done, what I was trying to do and then how could I find a way to do things such that it felt like I was delivering as well in my personal life as in my professional life.

I'm a married man, one child and another one on the way but is that an excuse for me not doing things? Am I really not doing things or is it a case of high expectations based on a previous single life where hacking away until 3 or 4 in the morning was fine. I decided that I should look at what I was doing and see how and if I could improve what I considered to be the productive work.

### What I learned

According to my wife I do have some uses and I do actually make myself useful, on occassions. This was the first thing that got me to change my mind set. While its all well and good delivering a great piece of code, or streatching yourself with new learning, you still have to function and have connections with those around you every day, keep the family happy and the house running. All of this contributes to your productivity and can block what you might think is you being productive. Reaching this understanding made me realise I shouldnt be focusing on the things I want to do but also the things I have to do.

### It works both ways

This got me thinking about the 20% that was being missed in work and where that was mostly coming from, usually meetings, even those that were planned for were often just considered to be part of the "slack" time we were given in each day. Adding up the time spent in these, often pushed over the slack time budget, once all other meetings were thrown in it was a surprise some of us actually delivered anything. We introduced project management tasks, based on expected meetings and added that it our tasks. While no perfect it suddenly gave a clear picture that they were a great over head and our task completion to hours spent improved significantly.

### What I did

I looked at everything that I needed to do, just as I did in work. Broke everything down into smaller chunks. This way I could plan out how to fit everything into the family commitments. Some of the tasks that are part of family life are also added as a task, they will take time and its time, that if you account for, you soon understand that you are being productive, just not in the way you normally think of it. After bouncing around lots of different tools I have come back to using Trello with a simple mix of scrum and kanban styles. Backlog as the dumping ground for all ideas, plans and things that I have been told need doing. Most of these are high level and as the time avails or they need to get done, they get broken down it to smaller chunks. Next are the things that needs doing this month. This is all pulled from the backlog and is a mixture of what really needs to be done and what I think I might get time for. I then have a column for each day of the week, jobs are pulled in from the month list, no more than two a day, with those that need to be done as the first ones in. It is limited to two per day so you cant get too behind and disheartened.
As things get completed they get moved in to the done column, at the end of the month its a good reflection point as to what has been done and can demonstrate, often, that the thoughts of not achieving is completely false.

### Takeaways

- Remember that everything you do in your life is about you being productive. Putting the bins out each week might not seem to add to your productivity but what would happen at home if you didnt?
- Break things down into smaller pieces. That allows for better planning and higher rate of delivery
- Take in to account the amount of time you really have available
- review what you have achieved, you will often be surprised at how much you have actually done
- Dont beat yourself up if you dont get everything done, you cant always estimate how long things will take or what other things might come along to stop you from hitting your targets
- give yourself some fun time as well

Just remember, as long as you are not just filling your life with things you consider wasteful, then you are being productive, no matter what you think!

### Finally

This is only my way of dealing with things, this has come about over a long period of time and is very much a mix of man different inputs. Yes I've tried the early mornings, the cold showers, the meditation, the late nights after everyone has gone to bed and while some of them worked, they affected other things that caused more problems than they resolved my productivity issue. I'm also not perfect but what I have discovered, if I stop following the plan above its not long until I end up actually delivering less and wondering why I'm so unproductive. So take on board a lot of ideas that are given to you, play with them and find out what works for you but dont expect that to work forever either...
